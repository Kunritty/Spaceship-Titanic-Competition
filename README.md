In this notebook, I have applied some basic data analysis, feature engineering, and model training to create a submission for Kaggle.com's Spaceship Titanic Competition. 
This dataset is fairly simple with only 14 features, meant as a beginner competition.
This is why I chose this to my first competition and application of my data science skills so far.
